# Distributed PyTorch Mining Framework

## Vision
This project aims to revolutionize distributed computing and mining by leveraging PyTorch and the Bittensor blockchain. It introduces a scalable, efficient, and secure system for training deep learning models across distributed nodes. Participants are rewarded in TAO cryptocurrency for their computational contributions, fostering a decentralized ecosystem of computational resources.

## Usefulness
- **Decentralized Computing:** Offers a framework for executing deep learning tasks across distributed nodes, reducing reliance on centralized cloud services.
- **Incentivization Scheme:** Integrates with Bittensor to reward miners and meta-miners based on their computational contributions and the validity of their work.
- **Flexibility and Scalability:** Easily scales with the addition of new nodes, suitable for a wide range of computational demands.

## How to Use
1. **Configure Miners:** Run `miner.py` on each participating node, specifying rank, world size, and validator URLs.
2. **Launch Orchestrator:** Start `orchestrator_simple_auth.py` to manage mining processes, including registration and task distribution.
3. **Meta Miner Operations:** Utilize `meta_miner.py` for higher-level management, allowing miners to run and crash without needing manual resets.
4. **Validator Script:** Engage the validator script to monitor statistical anomalies in loss and ensure model training integrity.

### Example Command
```shell
python miner.py --rank 0 --world-size 4 --validator-urls http://validator.example.com --epochs 10 --batch-size 64
```

## Bug Reporting and Contributions
- **Reporting Issues:** Use the GitHub Issues tab to report bugs, providing detailed steps to reproduce along with relevant logs or error messages.
- **Contributing:** Contributions are welcome! Fork the repo, make changes, and submit a pull request. Break it in as many ways as possible to help make the system resilient.

## Communication and Support
- Join our [Project Discord](#) and the [Bittensor Discord](#) to discuss the project, seek help, and collaborate with the community.
